# Lingual Arcade

This is an application that helps people to learn some simple phrases from different languages. It consists of three mini-games:
1.  A multi-choice quiz
2.  A card matching game
3.  A game where people can practice New Zealand Sign Language using visual detection.

## Languages available
- Spanish
- French
- German
- New Zealand Sign Language

## Details
This application has given me the chance to learn how to write an application in Java using the MVC design pattern. The Vision Detection game uses OpenCV to detect the sign gestures from a webcam and DeepLearning4j is used to detect gestures. This application uses the Hibernate Framework for database management and it also includes unit tests.
